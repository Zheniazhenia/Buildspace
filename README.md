# Buildspace---Build-a-Web3-app-with-Solidity

It's first Buildspace.co course for web3 developers. The link is down below:
https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app

During a course I:
- Get familiar with basic solidity
- Get a local Ethereum networking running
- Learn how to build a simple smart-contract
- Learn hot to compile contract and deploy it locally
- Setup a basic react app, setup Metamask
- Deploy a contract to Etherium Goerly Testnet Network
- Storing messages from users on the blockchain
- Fund contract, set a prize, and send users Ethereum
- Randomly pick a winner and prevent spammers

This course really helps newbies to first interact with blockchain development and open eyes on how it all works.
I am glad that I finded it and already planning to pass more courses on this platform.

During these processes I used:
Solidity for smart-contracts
Ether.js, Hardhat.js and Metamask for interacting w/ blockchain
QuickNode and Alchemy for deploying smart-contract
Dotenv to hide critical info
React.js for front-end
Replit platform for deploying website
HTML, CSS for visual
